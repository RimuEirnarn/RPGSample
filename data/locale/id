To write a localisation, first. We need to know the syntax. It's quite simple.
`@namespace $0 Locale string, no need to put " or '.
OR
`@namespace #Window The window name, yes.

Explanation:
    Anything started except with @ is marked as comments.
    Namespace is namespace. Place to put the identifier and text.
    And then, $ -- $ used to recognise certain text is numerical and will be used as identifier.
    That's the reason why there's no " or '
    # is used as string identifier. If you don't want to use $.
    But remember, 1 word only.

Then, let's give it a shot!
